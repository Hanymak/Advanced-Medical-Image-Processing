- Remember to put 'test_images' to right path.....

Package for classic image processing techniques:

- Thresholding package: containing Ostu and Reddi thresholding.

- Classification package and Param_estimate package: using Maximum likelihood estimate, estimating the bias field (and the tissue classification of an MR image) based on maximum likelihood parameter estimation using the EM algorithm. (see Van Leemput's paper: Automated Model-Based Bias Field Correction of MR Images of the Brain)

- Point_registration package: Containing point based registration using Optimization apporach (fminsearch) and ICP (see Dr. Fitzpatrick's paper)

- Nonrigid_registration package: using thin-plate spline,

- Intensity based registration package: using Mutual information (joint-entropy):

-Snake shape package: see paper Snake: Active Contour Models. A segmentation technique using snake models, minimizing the energy function defined by internal and external force which is driven by the edge map (the target contour). Using three types of forces: gradient map, distance map and GVF (Gradient Vector Flow: A New External Force for Snakes),

- demon_matching package: using demons algorithm (Thirion's paper: Image matching as a diffusion process: an analogy with Maxwellâ€™s demons) with image pyramid to perform the segmentation. An atlas-based segmentation of the ventricles, the intracranial cavity and the head contours of human brains:

- Active shape models package: containing hand segmentation using PCA algorithm.
